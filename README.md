# Simulating-Fluid-Dynamics

## Overview
[Progress on the Project has been temporarily stop]
>The Fluid Dynamics Simulation Program is a comprehensive software tool
>designed to simulate and analyze the behavior of fluids in various scenarios.
>This program is particularly useful for engineers, scientists, and researchers
>working in fields such as aerospace, civil engineering, environmental science, and fluid mechanics.
>The primary goal of the program is to provide a user-friendly and efficient platform for simulating fluid flow,
>understanding complex fluid dynamics phenomena, and optimizing designs.

## Goals
- [x] Start creating structure for program
- [x] Create particle and platform objects
- [x] Apply Physics to all objects and collision
- [ ] Create an algorithm to make the particles simulate like fluid
- [ ] Add gravity
- [ ] Revamp back the FPS to run smooth
- [ ] Create objects to test on
- [ ] Adjust code and fix bugs
- [ ] Acheive in creating a simulation of fluid in pygame with realistic physics and research, while making it customizable
- [ ] Refine it to make it realistic and run smooth
